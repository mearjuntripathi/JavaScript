# Code Structure

The first thing we’ll study is the building blocks of code.

## [Statements](readme.md#statements)

Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.

We’ve already seen a statement, `alert('Hello, world!')`, which shows the message “Hello, world!”.

We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.

For example, here we split “Hello World” into two alerts:

    alert('Hello'); alert('World');

Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable:

    alert('Hello');
    alert('World');

## [Semicolon](readme.md#semicolon)

A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.
