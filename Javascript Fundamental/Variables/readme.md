# Variable
Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. Here are two examples:

1. An online shop – the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.
2. A chat application – the information might include users, messages, and much more.

Variable is used to store these information.

## [A Variable](#a-variable)
A [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)) is "named storage" for data. We can use variable to store goodies, visitor, and other data.

To create a variable in JavaScript, use the `let` keyword.

The statement below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the name “message”:

    let message;

Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator `=` :

    let message;
    message = 'Hello, World!' // store the string 'Hello, World!' in the variable named message
