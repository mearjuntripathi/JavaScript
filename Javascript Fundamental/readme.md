# A JavaScript Fundamental

# Hello, World!

This part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the language itself.

But we need a working environment to run our scripts and, since this book is online, the browser is a good choice. We’ll keep the amount of browser-specific commands (like alert) to a minimum so that you don’t spend time on them if you plan to concentrate on another environment (like Node.js).

So first, let’s see how we attach a script to a webpage. For server-side environments (like Node.js), you can execute the script with a command like <kbd>"node my.js"</kbd>.

## [The “script” tag](./readme.md#the-script-tag)
JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the `<script>` tag.

For instance: [alert.html](./alert.html)

You can run the example alert.html in your browser.

The `<script>` tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.
